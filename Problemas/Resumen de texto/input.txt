The history of artificial intelligence (AI) dates back to antiquity - with myths, stories, and rumors of artificial 
beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. 
The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956. 
Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. 
Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they 
were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.
