Joy is a profound feeling that resonates in the heart and soul. 
It's not just a fleeting emotion, but a deep-rooted state of being.
 Joy is infectious, spreading like wildfire, touching everyone it comes into contact with. 
 But joy is not just about happiness. It's also about resilience, the ability to find light in the darkness, to find hope in despair.
