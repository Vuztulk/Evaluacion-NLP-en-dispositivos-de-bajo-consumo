I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France.
My best friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel room in the Latin Quarter, and it wasnâ€™t even expensive.
We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
We visited many famous tourist places.
